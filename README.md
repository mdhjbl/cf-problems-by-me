# cf-problems-by-me
My Codeforces problem solutions for competitive programming practice
# Codeforces Solutions (C++)

This repository contains my personal solutions to problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), written in **C++**.

It's part of my journey to become better at **competitive programming**, algorithms, and data structures.

## üìÇ Structure
- Each file is a solution to a single problem.
- File names include the problem ID and name.
- All solutions are written in **modern C++ (mostly C++17)** and include problem links as comments.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Example format

```cpp
// Problem: 4A - Watermelon
// Link: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/4/A
// Author: mdhjbl
// Language: C++

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int w;
    cin >> w;
    cout << ((w % 2 == 0 && w > 2) ? "YES" : "NO") << '\n';
    return 0;
}```
